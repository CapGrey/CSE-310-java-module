# Overview

This is my first java project. I wanted to take on a challenge to understand how the basics of java work.

This software is the game of hangman. It plays the game in the terminal of console. The user interacts with the program in the 
terminal. In the game, the user is given six attempts to guess the correct word. This is done by entering one letter at a time.
after a guess, the number of attempts left is shown (in the form of a slowly drawn man at the gallows. If the man is completely drawn,
the game ends) as well as what letters have been guessed and what have not. The letters and unknown values are shown in order.

My purpose in writing this software was to thouroughly understand java variables, arrays, classes, methods, and built in classes (such
as ArrayList). This project depicts all of these and more.
